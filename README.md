# Bikesharing: NYC CitiBike

## Overview

To see the Tableau Story for this analysis, click [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/NZMNX7GZK?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_linkem).

The purpose of this analysis was to take the data recieved from the bikesharing company, CitiBike, and turn it into visuals to be shared with investors looking to start a bikeshraing company in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis will show the following:
  - The length of time that bikes are checked out for all users as well as based on gender.
  - The number of bike trips for all users and genders based on each hour of each day of the week.
  - The number of bike trips for type of used and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
### Checkout Times

This first image represents how long the bikes are in use. The peak on the graph shows that most bikes, a little over 145,000 bikes, are in use for around 10 minutes, afterwhich, the duration tappers off. This means that most uses use the bikes for around 10 minutes at a time.

The image above shows how many bikes are used based on gender and for how long. From looking that this graph, it can be seen that males make up the majority of the users. There is about a 30,000 person difference between male and female. In addition, males tend to use the bikes for longer durations than females.

### Number of Trips

Once again, from this image, we can see that males make up the majority of the users since they have the darkest colors in their part of the graph. Although, the main purpose of this graph is to show what days are the most popular for the bikes to be used and what time of the day. For both males and females, the most popular days are work days, Monday through Friday,. The most popular times are in the mornings around 8AM and 5-7PM. This would mean the bikes are most likely being used for people's commute to and from work. Interesting enough, the bikes are used mostly in the late mornings to the afternoon on the weekends maybe for when people are doing various activities around the city.

This second graph just further exemplfies the point made above; bikes are mostly in use during the workdays around the time people would be taking their commute to and from work for all genders.
###
###
![user-trips-by-gender-by-weekday.png](https://github.com/mackalys/bikesharing/blob/main/bikesharing/images/user-trips-by-gender-by-weekday.png)
From looking at this graph, most rides are taken by subscripers to CitiBike. The majority of the subscribers are male and again, the weekdays are the most popular days for the bikes to be in use.

### Other Observations
![popular-start-locations.png](https://github.com/mackalys/bikesharing/blob/main/bikesharing/images/popular-start-locations.png)
![populat-end-locations.png](https://github.com/mackalys/bikesharing/blob/main/bikesharing/images/popular-end-locations.png)
Despite what you might think, these are two different images. The first being the locations where the users are starting their trips from and the second showing where the trips are being ended. It can be hypothesized that the reason why these two images are almost identical is because the CitiBike users are starting and stopping in the the same places each time. This would further support the claim made that the bikes are being used for commutes to and from work.

## Summary
From all the data we have collected and made apparent, it can be seen that:
  - The majority of the trips last around 10 minutes long.
  - The majority of users are subscribers and male.
  - Most bikes are in use during the week around 8AM and 5-7PM.
###
Based on these observations, I would suggest the following for the company in Des Moines.
###
  First, I would find all the residential areas that would fall within 10 minutes of areas that have a high concentration of offices and other work places. I would base where I placed the majority of the bikes in those areas. Based off that, I would put more bikes in those residential area in the mornings and more bikes in the work areas in the evening.
###
  Second, continuing with the map, I would create map that would show highly frequented tourist spots and place the bikes there so people can use them to commute to place to place easily.
###
  Third, I would advertise more towards female. The male users far outweigh the female users. There is a large market not being utilized so efforts should be to bringing women in to use the bikes.
###
  Lastly, I would create deals for subscribers. This could include prizes for when they reach a certain milage, time, etc. Anything that would bring people in to use the bikes and feel rewarded for using the bike company.

For future analysis, I would suggest, as I had mentioned before, making visuals for residential and work areas. This way the company owners can see if my hypothesis is correct about the bikes being used primarily for commutes to and from work. With this data, the company can use it to efficiently place the bikes in the best places for them to be put to use.
